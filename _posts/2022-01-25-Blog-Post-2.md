In this blog post, we will create a simple message bank webapp using `Flask`. We are going to use these basic skills:

- Flask fundamentals, including `render_template()`, the basic anatomy of templates, and user interactions.  
- Database skills, including adding items to databases and displaying them.  
- Basic CSS in order to add a bit of personal flare to your webapp.  

You will create your website by modifying Prof. Chodrow's [inclass template](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-interactions). Fork this to your github account first, then open it with Github desktop and start modifying the file in your local computer.

# Create __init__.py(app.py)

We start by creating this file, and it is our main file for the website. To run this website and watch for changes, we need to set directory to our current folder. After activate PIC16B cell, type `set FLASK_ENV=development` and then `flask run` in your command window. Copy and paste the output link to your browser, you should be able to see your website.

First of all, we need some standard imports.


```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pickle
import sqlite3

import io
import base64

app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Modify `base.html` file

We want a title and navigation links to submit and view page at the top of every webpage in our app. It is helpful to put them inside a template called `base.html`. We will extend `base.html` in `main.html`, `submit.html` and `view.html`.  

```html
{% raw %}
<!doctype html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - PIC16B Website</title>

<nav>
  <h1>PIC16B: A Simple Message Bank</h1>
  <!-- <b>Navigation:</b> -->
</nav>
<section class="content">
    <ul>
      <h1 style="font-size:1.875em; font-family: cursive;" ><li><a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">Submit a message</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ url_for('view') }}">View messages</a></li></h1>
    </ul>
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</section>
{% endraw %}
```

We have changed the original title, and added the navigation links to the content part.

## Welcome Page

We could easily create a main page by typing in this to our `.py` file. 


```python
# Create main page
@app.route('/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def main():
    return render_template("main.html")
```

This is basically calling `main.html`. In `main.html`, we will extend `base.html` to keep the title, then simply add a welcome message. 

```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
<p>Welcome to this simple message bank webapp!</p>
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```

Great! Now we have successfully constructed our welcome page. It should look like this(We will talk about how to change the font and color in later sections. Don't worry about it for now if your background looks different).

## Submit Page

In this page, we are going to create a submit template with three user interface elements:  

- A text box for submitting a message.  
- A text box for submitting the name of the user.  
- A "submit" button. 

To create a textbox, use this line `<input name="message">` and replace "message" with any name you want to give to the input of the textbox.  
To create a submit button, type in `<input type="submit" value="Submit form">`.	This displays a submit button for submitting the form.  
Then our `submit.html` will look like:  

```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<center>
<p><h2><strong>Please Submit Your Message Here</strong></h2></p>
  <form method="post">
      <label for="message">Your message: </label><br>
      <input name="message">
      <br>
      <label for="message">Your name or handle: </label><br>
      <input name="handle">
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit form">
  </form>
</center>
  {% if thanks %}
    Thank you for submitting a message!
  {% endif %}


{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```

We extend `base.html` and add `<center>` and `</center>` to center all messages. Also, don't forget to include a thank you message.

Next, we are going to write two Python functions for database management in a new file `app.py`.

To handle creating the database of messages, we will write a function called `get_message_db()`. This function doesn't have any input statement. What it does is basically modifying the database in the `g` attribute of the app. In this function, we are going to:  
- Check whether there is a database called `message_db` in the `g` attribute of the app. If not, then connect to that database, ensuring that the connection is an attribute of `g`. To do this last step, write a line like do `g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")`.
- Check whether a table called `messages` exists in `message_db`, and create it if not. For this purpose, the SQL command `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is helpful. Give the table an id column (integer), a handle column (text), and a message column (text).
- Return the connection `g.message_db`.


```python
def get_message_db():
    # Check whether there is a database called message_db in the g attribute of the app
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        #  If not, then connect to that database, ensuring that the connection is an attribute of g
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")

    if g.message_db is not None:
        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
        # Check whether a table called messages exists in message_db, and create it if not
        sql_create_messages_table = """ CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
                                    id integer,
                                    handle text,
                                    messages text
                                ); """
        cursor.execute(sql_create_messages_table)
    # Return the connection
    return g.message_db
```

To handle inserting a user message into the database of messages, we are going to write a function called `insert_message(request)`. The input is the request, which contains the user's input data.   
- The first step is extracting the message and the handle from request. This step is based on assuming that the `submit.html` template creates the message and the handle fields from user input by appropriately specifying the name of the input elements. In the previous step, we wrote `<input name="message">` and `<input name="handle">`.  We should be able to return them by `request.form["message"]` and `request.form["handle"]`.
- The second step is, insert the message into the message database. To do this we will need to use a cursor, and write a SQL command to perform the insertion. In the SQL command we need to specify the column name and the corresponding value we are going to insert. The structure is like this: `INSERT INTO messages (id, handle, messages) VALUES (nrow, 'handle, message)`. To save this inserted row, we need to run `db.commit()` after inserting a row into `messages.db`.
- To assign unique ID numbers to each messages, we are going to set the ID number of a message equal to one plus the current number of rows in `message_db`. To get the number of rows in the database, we will select all rows and count the length.
- It’s good practice to close your database connection once you’re done using it. In this case, we need to close the database connection within the function.


```python
def insert_message(request):
    # open the connection
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    # Extract message and handle
    message = request.form["message"]
    handle = request.form["handle"]
    
    # get nrow and assign unique id
    n_row = cursor.execute('select * from messages;')
    nrow = len(n_row.fetchall()) + 1
    
    # add a new row to messages database
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO messages (id, handle, messages) VALUES ({nrow}, '{handle}', '{message}')".format(
         nrow = nrow, handle = handle, message = message))
    # Save the change
    g.message_db.commit()
    # close the connection
    g.message_db.close()
```

Finally, we are going to write a function called `submit()` in `app.py` to `render_template()` the `submit.html` template. Since this page will both transmit and receive data, we should ensure that it supports both POST and GET methods by setting `methods=['POST', 'GET']`, and give it appropriate behavior in each one. In the GET case, we can just render the `submit.html` template with no other parameters. In the POST case, we should call `insert_message()` to insert what the user has inputted, and then render the `submit.html` template. We will also add a small note thanking the user for their submission.


```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else: # if request.method == 'POST'
        try:
            insert_message(request)
            return render_template('submit.html', thanks = True)
        except:
            return render_template('submit.html')
```

Now you have created your Submit Page. It should look like this in your webapp:

![image-Blog_Post_2_image1.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JadenWSR/JadenWSR.github.io/master/images/Blog_Post_2_image1.jpg)

And it will return a thank you message after you submitted your message:

![image-Blog_Post_2_image2.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JadenWSR/JadenWSR.github.io/master/images/Blog_Post_2_image2.jpg)

## View Page

To view all the submitted messages, we will need a helper function to extract them. We will write a function called `random_messages(n)` which will return a collection of n random messages from the `message_db`, or fewer if necessary. To select random n rows from the database, we need to use `ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT n` in our SQL command. As I mentioned above, it’s good practice to close your database connection once you’re done using it. In this case, we need to close the database connection within the function.


```python
def random_messages(n):
    # open the connection
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    # Get a collection of n random messages from the message_db, or fewer if necessary
    messages = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT {n})".format(n = n), g.message_db)
    # close the connection
    g.message_db.close()
    return messages
```

Next, write a new template called `view.html` to display the messages extracted from `random_messages()`. In this `messages` table, the second column of `messages` table is message, and the third column is handle/name. We first loop through messages by row, then call the column we want using `[]`, and specify the format of the output. {{ row[2]}} is handle/name, the element on the third column of the row. {{row [1]}} is message, the element on the second column of the row.  

```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<center>
<p><h2><strong>Some Cool Messages</strong></h2></p>

{% for index, row in messages.iterrows() %}
<strong>{{ row[2]}}</strong><br>
--<em>{{row[1]}}</em><br>
<br>
{% endfor %}
</center>

{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```

Again, we extend `base.html`. I have added `<center>` and `</center>` to center all messages.

Finally, we need one last function called `view()` to render the `view.html` template.


```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
    try:
        messages = random_messages(5)
        return render_template('view.html', messages = messages)
    except:
        return render_template('view.html', error = True)
```

This function should first call `random_messages()` to grab some random messages (I chose a cap of 5), and then pass these messages as an argument to `render_template()`.

Now you have created your View Page. It should look like this in your webapp:

![image-Blog_Post_2_image3.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JadenWSR/JadenWSR.github.io/master/images/Blog_Post_2_image3.jpg)

## Modify Style.css to change Webapp Appearance

You should be able to change the Webapp Appearance by modifying `style.css`. For example, to change the font family and background color, here is what I did:

```css
html {
    font-family: "New Century Schoolbook";
    background: #add8e6;
    padding: 1rem;
}
```

Similarly, you can also change other settings in this file. Just change the corresponding section accordingly and you should be able to see all the changes by refreshing your Webapp. Feel free to add additional CSS (and modify your templates if necessary) in order to give your app a personal feel.

Congratulations! Now you have successfully built a simple message bank webapp!

Lastly, here is a link to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JadenWSR/flask-interactions) containing the code for the app.
