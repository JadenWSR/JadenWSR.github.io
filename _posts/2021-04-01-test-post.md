I'm an awesome PIC16B student and I am running Jekyll! 

This is a test. Some exciting text in my text file.

### Try making a header:
    Third level header (number of # controls level)

### Try making a numbered or bulleted list
* This is a bulleted list.
* You can create this by adding * before each bullet point

1. This is a numbered list.
2. I'm currently using VSCode.

### Try adding math!

$f(x) = \frac{e^{2x +3y}}{log_2^{3y-6x}} + 125x - 2341y, x\in \{0, 1\}, y \in \{2, 3\}$

### Try adding code!

```python
def f(x):
    """
    A cool function that multiples an input x by 25. 
    """
    return 25*x
```
 
```python
print("to boldly go")
```
`to boldly go`

### Tra adding images
